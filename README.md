# Pokedex

The purpose of this project was to build a pokedex using the http://pokeapi.co/ api. It was built with EmberJs, my first time using this framework. 

###Useage 

`git clone`

`npm install`

`simplehttpserver`

###Testing

To run tests simply run the server `simplehttpserver` and add `?test` to the end of the url.

##Improvements

- Incorporating Ember-data as to better manage the stored data.

- Testing needs to be more thorough.

- Learn EmberJs better as to take better advantage of the controller.
